"The Secret Garden Discovery"

(198 words | Lexile: 450L | Includes multi-syllabic words, blends, digraphs)

Maya loved exploring her grandmother's old house. Every room held treasures from the past—dusty books, faded photographs, and mysterious boxes.

One rainy Saturday afternoon, Maya discovered something unusual in the attic. Behind a tall wooden cabinet, she found a small door she had never noticed before. The brass doorknob was covered in cobwebs, but it still turned.

Maya pushed the door open and gasped. Sunlight streamed through a dusty window, revealing a hidden room filled with gardening tools, seed packets, and journals. She carefully opened one of the journals. The pages were yellowed with age, but she could still read her grandmother's neat handwriting.

"My Secret Garden Plans - 1965" the first page read.

Maya's eyes widened as she flipped through sketches of flowers, vegetables, and a beautiful fountain. Her grandmother had dreamed of creating a magical garden but never told anyone about it.

Maya raced downstairs, journal in hand. She couldn't wait to share this discovery with her grandmother. Perhaps together, they could finally bring those fifty-year-old dreams to life.

GRADE 5-6 DIAGNOSTIC PASSAGE

"The Truth About Lightning"

(312 words | Lexile: 650L | Informational text with complex vocabulary)

Most people believe that lightning strikes from the sky down to the ground. However, scientists have discovered that lightning actually works in both directions at once—a process that happens so quickly the human eye cannot detect it.

When storm clouds form, ice particles collide inside the cloud, creating an electrical charge. The bottom of the cloud becomes negatively charged, while the top becomes positively charged. This separation of charges creates tension, like stretching a rubber band until it must snap.

Here's where it gets fascinating: The negative charge at the cloud's base causes a positive charge to build up on the ground below. This positive charge follows the cloud like a shadow, concentrating on tall objects such as trees, buildings, and even people.

When the electrical tension becomes too great, a stepped leader—a channel of negative charge—zigzags down from the cloud. It moves in steps, pausing and branching as it searches for the best path. The stepped leader is invisible to our eyes.

Meanwhile, positive streamers reach up from the ground, trying to connect with the descending leader. When they finally meet, usually about 300 feet above the ground, an electrical circuit completes. At this moment, a brilliant flash of light travels up through the established channel—this return stroke is what we actually see as lightning. The return stroke carries massive amounts of electricity and heats the air to 54,000 degrees Fahrenheit, five times hotter than the sun's surface.

So when someone says, "Lightning struck that tree," they're only half right. The lightning both came down from the cloud and went up from the tree simultaneously. The spectacular flash we see is actually the upward movement of electricity, not the downward strike.

Understanding how lightning works helps scientists predict strikes and develop better safety measures, potentially saving thousands of lives each year.

MIDDLE SCHOOL DIAGNOSTIC PASSAGES

GRADE 7-8 DIAGNOSTIC PASSAGE

"The Invisible Barrier"

(428 words | Lexile: 850L | Narrative with complex themes)

Kenji pressed his face against the cool glass of the bus window, watching his old neighborhood fade into the distance. Six months ago, his family had moved from Little Tokyo to the suburbs—a "better opportunity," his parents called it. Better schools. Safer streets. A fresh start.

But Kenji didn't feel fresh. He felt erased.

At his new school, Lincoln Middle, Kenji was one of only three Asian students. During lunch, he sat alone, methodically eating the bento box his grandmother had prepared. He noticed other kids staring at his food—octopus balls, pickled vegetables, rice shaped like cartoon characters. Their cafeteria trays held pizza and chicken nuggets.

"What is that?" a voice asked. Kenji looked up to see Marcus, a boy from his English class, gesturing at his lunch.

"Um, it's Japanese food. My grandma makes it," Kenji replied carefully, bracing himself for mockery.

But Marcus surprised him. "That's actually cool. My mom never has time to make anything—we just eat whatever's fastest." He paused, then added, "Can I sit here?"

Kenji nodded, and Marcus dropped his tray onto the table.

"So, you just moved here, right?" Marcus continued. "Must be weird."

"Yeah," Kenji admitted. "Everything's different. At my old school, lots of kids brought homemade lunches. Here, everyone stares like I'm from another planet."

Marcus laughed, but not unkindly. "I get it. I moved here three years ago from Detroit. Back there, I was just... normal. Here, people see me and assume things. They're not always bad assumptions, but they're not really about me, you know?"

Kenji did know. He'd spent six months feeling defined by his difference rather than his personality—as if his ethnicity was the most interesting thing about him, when really, he cared more about basketball and graphic novels.

"Do you play any sports?" Marcus asked, as if reading his mind.

"Basketball," Kenji said. "Not great, but I like it."

"Me too! Tryouts are next week. We should go together."

For the first time since moving, Kenji felt the invisible barrier around him begin to crack. It wasn't completely gone—he still felt the weight of being "different" in ways his old neighbors never had. But Marcus's simple act of sitting down, of asking questions rather than making assumptions, had created a small opening.

As the lunch period ended, Kenji carefully packed his bento box, feeling lighter. Maybe this fresh start wasn't about erasing who he was. Maybe it was about finding people who saw past the surface to discover who he actually was underneath.

☐ Answer: ___________________________________________________________________

Question 11: The story ends with Kenji realizing the fresh start "wasn't about erasing who he was" but "finding people who saw past the surface." Do you agree with this message? Explain your reasoning.

☐ Answer: ___________________________________________________________________

Question 12: How does the author's choice to show Kenji's experience through his lunch scene (rather than just telling us he felt different) strengthen the story?

PARENT ADMINISTRATION GUIDELINES

Creating the Right Environment

DO:

✅ Choose a quiet, comfortable time (not when child is tired or hungry)

✅ Frame it positively: "I want to see what you can do so I can help you best!"

✅ Allow child to read silently first, then aloud

✅ Give wait time (10-15 seconds) before prompting on comprehension questions

✅ Mark errors discreetly (don't interrupt reading to correct)

DON'T:

❌ Say "This is a test" or create pressure

❌ Interrupt while child is reading

❌ Show frustration if child struggles

❌ Compare to siblings or other children

❌ Rush through—this is diagnostic, not timed

Administering the Diagnostic (Step-by-Step)

STEP 1: Set the Stage (2 minutes) "I'm going to have you read a short passage, and then I'll ask you some questions about it. This helps me figure out exactly how to help you become an even stronger reader. Ready?"

STEP 2: Silent Reading First (3-5 minutes) Hand child the passage. "First, read this silently to yourself. Take your time."

STEP 3: Oral Reading (3-5 minutes) "Now, please read it out loud to me." Mark errors on your copy as the child reads.

STEP 4: Comprehension Questions (10-15 minutes) Ask questions one at a time. Allow the child to look back at the text. Mark answers on the scoring sheet.

STEP 5: Review & Encouragement (2 minutes) "Great job! You worked really hard on that. I learned a lot about how to help you."

PASSAGE

(201 words | Lexile: 450L)

Jordan stared at the empty poster board on his desk. The science fair was in three days, and everyone else in his class seemed to have amazing projects. Mia was building a volcano. Carlos had a robot that sorted recycling. Jordan had nothing.

"What if I'm just not good at science?" Jordan mumbled, slumping in his chair.

His older brother Dante walked by and paused. "What are you working on?"

"Nothing. I can't think of any ideas," Jordan admitted.

Dante sat down beside him. "What do you wonder about? What questions do you ask yourself?"

Jordan thought for a moment. "Well, I always wonder why my skateboard wheels wear out faster on one side than the other."

Dante's face lit up. "That's perfect! That's friction and weight distribution. You could test it—try different surfaces, different speeds, measure the wear patterns."

Jordan's eyes widened. "That's actually science?"

"The best science starts with real questions," Dante explained. "You don't need fancy equipment. You need curiosity."

By the end of the evening, Jordan had sketched out his entire experiment. His poster board wasn't empty anymore—it was filled with hypotheses, diagrams, and observations about something he genuinely cared about.

Maybe he was better at science than he thought.

VERSION C: "The Library Card"(POST-ASSESSMENT - Day 21)

PASSAGE

(195 words | Lexile: 450L)

Rosa clutched her brand-new library card like it was made of gold. For weeks, she'd saved her allowance to pay the lost book fee from two years ago. Now, finally, she could check out books again.

The librarian, Mrs. Chen, smiled warmly. "Welcome back, Rosa. We've missed you."

Rosa felt her cheeks flush. She'd been too embarrassed to come to the library after losing that book, even though she loved reading more than almost anything.

"I'm sorry it took so long to pay the fee," Rosa said quietly.

Mrs. Chen leaned forward. "You know what impressed me? You came back. Many people would have given up on the library entirely. But you valued it enough to make it right."

Rosa hadn't thought about it that way. She'd just felt guilty.

"Now," Mrs. Chen continued, sliding three thick books across the counter, "I set these aside for you. They're the new fantasy series everyone's been requesting. I had a feeling you'd be back."

Rosa's eyes went wide. Someone had believed she would return—had saved books just for her.

She tucked her library card safely in her pocket. She would never lose it again.

PASSAGE

Every autumn, trees put on a spectacular show. Leaves transform from green to brilliant shades of yellow, orange, red, and purple. Many people assume that cold temperatures cause this change, but the real explanation involves chemistry, sunlight, and survival strategies.

During spring and summer, leaves are green because they contain chlorophyll, a molecule that captures sunlight for photosynthesis—the process plants use to make food. Chlorophyll is so abundant and vibrant that it masks other pigments present in the leaf.

However, as days grow shorter in autumn, trees receive a critical signal: winter is approaching. Deciduous trees—those that shed their leaves—begin preparing for the harsh season ahead. Since leaves require significant resources to maintain and would be damaged by freezing temperatures anyway, trees start to shut them down.

First, trees form a barrier layer of cells at the base of each leaf stem, blocking the flow of nutrients and water. Without these supplies, chlorophyll production stops. As existing chlorophyll breaks down and isn't replaced, it gradually disappears from the leaf.

Here's where the color show begins: With the green chlorophyll gone, other pigments that were always present become visible. Carotenoids, which produce yellow and orange hues, were in the leaf all along. The brilliant yellows of birch and aspen trees and the oranges of sugar maples come from these unmasked pigments.

Red and purple colors have a different origin. Some trees produce anthocyanins in autumn—pigments that weren't present during summer. Scientists believe anthocyanins may protect leaves from sun damage during the breakdown process, or they might help trees reabsorb maximum nutrients before the leaves fall.

The exact timing and intensity of fall colors depend on weather conditions. Warm, sunny days and cool (but not freezing) nights produce the most vibrant displays. Drought or early frost can dull the colors or cause leaves to drop before reaching peak brilliance.

Understanding leaf color change reveals that autumn beauty isn't just decoration—it's a tree's sophisticated survival mechanism in action.

VERSION C: "The Secret Language of Bees" (POST-ASSESSMENT - Day 21)

PASSAGE

(315 words | Lexile: 650L | Informational text)

When a honeybee discovers a rich source of nectar, she faces a communication challenge: how can she tell thousands of other bees the exact location of flowers that might be miles away? Unlike humans, bees cannot draw maps or speak directions. Instead, they perform an elaborate dance.

Austrian scientist Karl von Frisch spent decades studying bee behavior and discovered that honeybees use two distinct dance patterns to communicate distance and direction. For his groundbreaking research, he won the Nobel Prize in 1973.

The "round dance" signals that food is nearby—within about 50 meters of the hive. The bee moves in tight circles, alternating between clockwise and counterclockwise rotations. Other bees crowd around, touching the dancer with their antennae to learn the scent of the flowers. This simple dance says, "Food is close! Go out and search!"

The "waggle dance" conveys more sophisticated information for distant food sources. The bee performs a figure-eight pattern with a waggle run down the middle. The angle of the waggle run relative to vertical represents the direction of the food source relative to the sun's position. If the bee waggles straight up, the flowers are toward the sun. If she wiggles 40 degrees to the right of the vertical, other bees know to fly 40 degrees to the right of the sun's position.

Distance is encoded in the duration of the waggle run. A longer waggle means a farther destination. Bees can communicate locations up to six miles away with remarkable accuracy.

This dance language is even more impressive because bees must constantly recalculate. As the sun moves across the sky, the dance angle must adjust accordingly. A bee who discovers food at 9:00 AM and returns at noon to recruit help must modify her dance to account for the sun's changed position.

The waggle dance represents one of nature's most sophisticated examples of symbolic communication outside of human language.

PASSAGE

(425 words | Lexile: 850L | Narrative with ethical complexity)

The acceptance letter lay on Aisha's desk like an accusation. Riverside Academy—the elite private school across town—wanted her. Full scholarship. State-of-the-art science labs. College counselors. A 98% graduation rate.

It should have been the easiest decision of her life.

"You're going, right?" her best friend Janelle asked during lunch, eyes wide with excitement. "This is huge, Aisha. My cousin went there and got into Stanford."

Aisha forced a smile. "Yeah, probably."

But that night at dinner, when she showed her parents the letter, her mother's expression was complicated—pride mixed with something else. Something that looked like worry.

"That's wonderful, baby," her mom said carefully. "But you know Riverside is forty-five minutes away. I'd have to adjust my shifts, and..."

She didn't finish, but Aisha understood. Her mother worked two jobs. Her younger brother needed supervision after school. The carefully balanced system that kept their household functioning would collapse under the weight of this opportunity.

"I could take the bus," Aisha offered, though she'd already researched it. Two transfers. Ninety minutes each way.

Her father put down his fork. "You've worked hard for this. We'll figure something out."

But Aisha had seen the bills stacked on the counter. She'd heard her parents' whispered conversations about overtime and budgets. She thought about Mr. Washington, her science teacher at King High, who stayed late twice a week to help her with AP Chemistry. She thought about Janelle, who'd been her partner on every group project since sixth grade. She thought about the community garden project she'd started last year, teaching elementary kids about urban farming.

Riverside Academy had resources King High couldn't dream of. But King High had Mr. Washington, who believed in her. It had Janelle, who made her laugh during difficult days. It had students who needed someone to prove that excellence could emerge from their hallways too.

The realization hit Aisha like a wave: she didn't want to leave.

Not because she was afraid. Not because she couldn't succeed at Riverside. But because success wasn't just about personal achievement—it was about what you contributed to your community.

"I'm staying at King," Aisha said suddenly, surprising even herself.

Her parents exchanged glances.

"Are you sure?" her mother asked. "We don't want you to limit yourself—"

"I'm not limiting myself," Aisha interrupted gently. "I'm choosing where I can make the biggest difference. And that's here."

The acceptance letter still sat on her desk that night. But instead of an accusation, it felt like validation: she was good enough for Riverside. She was also good enough to choose a different path.

VERSION C: "Breaking the Algorithm" (POST-ASSESSMENT - Day 21)

PASSAGE

(432 words | Lexile: 850L | Narrative with contemporary themes)

Mira had become predictable. Not in real life—but to the algorithm.

Every morning, her phone's recommendation engine served up the same content: videos about skateboarding, indie music playlists, climate activism posts. The algorithm had analyzed her clicks, her pauses, her likes. It knew her patterns better than she knew herself. And increasingly, Mira realized she'd stopped discovering anything new.

"You ever feel like your feed just shows you the same stuff?" Mira asked her friend Devon as they walked home from school.

Devon shrugged. "That's kind of the point. It learns what you like."

"But what if I don't know what else I might like?" Mira countered. "What if I'm missing entire categories of interesting things because I've never clicked on them?"

Devon looked confused. "So... click on different things?"

That night, Mira conducted an experiment. She called it "Breaking the Algorithm."

First, she watched a documentary about marine biology—something completely outside her usual interests. Then she listened to classical music. She read articles about architecture, searched for recipes from countries she'd never heard of, and watched tutorials on woodworking.

At first, her feed resisted. It kept trying to pull her back to familiar content, like a current dragging her toward shore. But after three days of intentional exploration, something shifted.

Her recommendations became chaotic—a glorious, disorganized mess of ideas. A video essay about Gothic cathedrals appeared next to a skateboarding clip. A Japanese jazz playlist preceded a documentary on urban planning. The algorithm was confused, scrambling to categorize her, trying to find new patterns.

And in that confusion, Mira found freedom.

She discovered she loved watching time-lapse videos of storms. She learned about biomimicry—designing technology inspired by nature. She found poets she'd never encountered, musicians who blended genres she didn't know could mix, and ideas that challenged her assumptions.

"My feed is completely weird now," Mira told Devon a week later, showing him the eclectic mix.

"Looks broken," Devon said.

"Exactly," Mira grinned. "I broke it on purpose."

Devon scrolled through her recommendations, pausing occasionally. "That architecture video actually looks cool," he admitted.

Mira realized something important: algorithms optimized for engagement, not growth. They showed you what you already liked, creating an echo chamber of familiar thoughts. But real learning—real discovery—required discomfort. It required being willing to encounter ideas that didn't fit your existing patterns.

"I'm keeping it broken," Mira decided. "The algorithm can guess all it wants. I'm going to stay unpredictable."

In a world designed to know her completely, Mira had found power in remaining unknown—even to herself.
