Octopuses are masters of camouflage, able to change both the color and texture of their skin to match their surroundings in less than a second. This ability helps them hide from predators and sneak up on prey.\n\nDespite having no bones, octopuses are remarkably strong and flexible. They can squeeze through openings as small as their beaks, which are the only hard parts of their bodies. Scientists have discovered that octopuses are highly intelligent, capable of solving complex puzzles and even using tools. In laboratory studies, octopuses have opened jars to reach food inside and have learned to navigate mazes.\n\nPerhaps most surprisingly, octopuses have three hearts and blue blood! Two hearts pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps blood to the rest of the body. Their blood is blue because it contains copper-based molecules called hemocyanin, which are better at transporting oxygen in cold, low-oxygen environments than the iron-based hemoglobin found in human blood.",

              "title": "Passage 2: The History of Flight",
              "passage": "For centuries, humans dreamed of soaring through the sky like birds. While ancient civilizations created myths about winged humans and gods who could fly, it wasn't until the late 18th century that humans achieved real flight. In 1783, the Montgolfier brothers launched the first successful hot air balloon in France, carrying passengers high above the ground. This was a thrilling breakthrough, but the balloon could only drift with the wind—it couldn't be steered.\n\nThe next major advancement came in 1903 when Orville and Wilbur Wright achieved the first powered, controlled airplane flight in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Their aircraft, the Wright Flyer, stayed airborne for only 12 seconds and traveled just 120 feet, but this brief flight changed the world forever. The Wright brothers had solved the puzzle of controlled flight by carefully studying how birds use their wings to balance and steer.\n\nAviation technology advanced rapidly after the Wright brothers' success. During World War I, airplanes were used for reconnaissance and combat. In 1927, Charles Lindbergh became the first person to fly solo nonstop across the Atlantic Ocean, a journey that took 33 hours. By the 1950s, commercial jet airliners like the Boeing 707 made air travel faster and more accessible to ordinary people. Today, millions of passengers fly every day, and modern aircraft can travel at speeds exceeding 500 miles per hour, making the world more connected than ever before.",

          "passage": "In the heart of a bustling city, tucked between two tall apartment buildings, there once existed a forgotten garden. No one knew who planted it or why it was there, but tall sunflowers, clusters of lavender, and vines of cherry tomatoes thrived in its cozy corner, shielded from the noise and rush. The residents passed it by daily, barely giving it a second glance—until one day, everything changed.\n\nA girl named Maya, curious and observant, noticed the garden one afternoon as she returned home from school. A shimmering butterfly had caught her eye, leading her through a narrow alley and into the tiny green oasis. It was as though she had stepped into a different world. A wooden bench stood under an ivy-covered arch, birds chirped from the fence, and in the center grew an ancient plum tree whose trunk twisted like the strokes of a paintbrush.\n\nMaya visited daily. She brought a notebook, sketching flowers, noting the wildlife, and documenting the growth of vegetables. Soon, others followed. An elderly man brought his harmonica, playing soft tunes that mingled with the breeze. A teacher from the local school began a composting project with her students. A once-forgotten space became a place of connection and creativity.\n\nBut as the garden flourished, developers took notice. One morning, a sign appeared: \"Future Site of Luxury Apartments.\" The neighborhood buzzed with concern. Maya, heartbroken but determined, launched a campaign to save the garden. She held petitions, wrote articles, and even organized a \"Garden Day\" where neighbors shared their stories and planted new seeds.\n\nThe community's efforts reached the city council. After much deliberation and several town hall meetings, the land was designated a protected community space. The sign was removed, and in its place, a plaque was installed: \"The People's Garden – A Sanctuary for Growth, Nature, and Unity.\"\n\nYears later, Maya, now a botanist, often visited the garden that first sparked her love for nature. And every time she sat on the wooden bench beneath the plum tree, she remembered the butterfly—and the moment everything changed.",
